=== DESCRIPTION ============================================================
This directory contains a workflow example using Chiron. Each of the three 
workflow activities corresponds to an invocation of a SPOC application.

=== SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS ============================================================
This workflow execution have the following software requirements:
1) Postgres Database Management System (DBMS) (www.postgresql.org)
2) SPOC (http://mathiasbourgoin.github.io/SPOC)

=== ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION ============================================================
To use these softwares correctly in this workflow, please configure them as follows:
1) Configuration of a relational database using Postgres DBMS.
2) Compilation of the SPOC application code.
3) Configuration of the file "input.dataset" in directory "exp", which represents the input
relation from this workflow using Chiron.

Obs(1): After the Postgres DBMS installation, please configure a relational database
in this DBMS using the SQL script to generate the database schema to be used by
Chiron. This SQL script is named as "chiron-database.sql" in directory "bin"

Obs(2): To compile SPOC application code, please access the directory of this 
application and execute make command in Linux-based operating system, as follows:
$ cd bin/app-directory
$ make clean
$ make

Obs(3): File with input dataset need to have all file paths updated according to the current 
file system.

=== WORKFLOW EXECUTION ==========================================================================
To submit workflow execution using Chiron, please execute the following script:
$ ./submit.sh

Obs(4): This script invokes other three scripts, named as "delete.sh", "restore.sh", and "execute.sh".
The former script deletes all directories generated from previous workflow executions in "exp" 
directory. The second script executes ChironSetup in order to update the conceptual workflow in
database. The third script invokes ChironCore to execute the workflow considering the conceptual 
definition in Postgres's relational database.
